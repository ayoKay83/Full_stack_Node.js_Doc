<h3>JavaScript best practices</h3>    
<p>JavaScript was introduced in 1995 and has since become "the language of the web”.</p>
<p>The following are an attempt to explain some basic printiciples and touch upon
    best pratices.</p>

<h3>Variables</h3>
<p>Variables are symbolic names that creates a binding to a value. It dosn’t actually contain the value itself since you can have several variables that points to the same value. It’s just a representation. We can identify a variable by giving it a meaningful name also called a variable identifier.</p>
<p>let variableWithMeaningfulName = “Hello, I am a variable with a meaningful name”</p>
<p>let anotherVariableWithAMeaningfulName = "Hello, I am a variable with a meaningful name”</p>

<h3>Declarations</h3>
<p>Variables can be declared outside of functions which makes them global variables that can be accessed anywhere on the document/script.
    If you declare a variable inside a function it has a local scope and can only be accessed within that function. But local scope can either mean function scope or block scope depending on the type of declaration you use.
    When we declare a variable in JavaScript we can use 3 types of variable declaration:
    </p>
<p><strong>var</strong> - declares a function scoped variable,  optionally initializing it to a value that can change throughout the program.</p>
<p><strong>let</strong> - declares a block scoped variable,  optionally initializing it to a value that can change throughout the program.</p>
<p><strong>const</strong> - declares a block scoped variable that dosen’t change throughout the program (it’s read-only).</p>
<h3>Hoisting</h3>
<p>Hoisting is JavaScripts behaviour of moving all declarations to the top of the scope. For this reason (while using var) it’s possible to use a variable before it is declared.
    However the initialization is not hoisted. </p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript"> //this code will run and display undefined
  console.log(x)
  var x = 5;
  
  //JavaScript will hoist the declaration but NOT the initialization
  //and execute the code in the following order
  var x;  //declaration
  console.log(x);
  x = 5;  //initialization
</code></pre>
<p>Because x is displayed before it is initialized it will return undefined.
    Looking at the same code, if you use <em>let</em> to declare x it will result in a ReferenceError and declaring a <em>const</em> variable after it has been used results in a SyntaxError. 
</p>
<p>NB!<em>To avoid issues with hoisting always declare your variables at the top of your scope or script.</em></p>
<h3>Asynchronous operations</h3>
<p>JavaScript is single-threaded but allows for asynchronous behaviour meaning that you can have several operations running in parallel.
    E.g. you run a function A and this function will start another function B before function A executes. Whenever Function B has finished it’s task it will notify function A and return the result (if any).</p>
<h3>Callback functions</h3>

<p>Callback functions are functions that are passed as arguments in other functions.</p>
<h3>Immutability and loops</h3>
<p>Callback functions are functions that are passed as arguments in other functions.</p>
